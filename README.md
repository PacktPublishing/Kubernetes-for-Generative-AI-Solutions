## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, ch2.

The code will look like the following:
```
...
  metadata {
    name = "gp2"
...
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for solutions architects, product managers, engineering leads, DevOps teams, GenAI developers, and AI engineers. It's also suitable for students and academics learning about GenAI, Kubernetes, and cloud-native technologies. A basic understanding of cloud computing and AI concepts is needed, but no prior knowledge of Kubernetes is required.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-14).
